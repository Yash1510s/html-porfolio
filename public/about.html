<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Yash Vijay Singh, a second-year Computer Science student at Xavier Institute of Engineering in Mahim, Mumbai. I'm on an exciting journey through the world of technology, driven by a passion for figuring out how things work.</p>

<p>I’ve dipped my toes into web development and even tackled a 6-day Cyber Security workshop at my college. I was thrilled to snag 4th place in the Cyber Sage Hacktify competition! Right now, I'm diving into various courses to broaden my IT knowledge, sharpening my skills, and working on a cool mini-project that I can’t wait to share once it's finished.</p>

<p>What really gets me going is understanding the magic behind our everyday tech—from simple apps to the complex code behind video games. My goal? To learn, grow, and make my parents proud with my achievements.</p>
<p>I'm also someone who loves to lend a helping hand. I often end up juggling multiple tasks because saying no is tough for me. As the class representative for the past two years, I’ve learned how to manage and lead effectively, whether it’s organizing class activities or spearheading project teams.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by to learn a bit about me. I’m excited about the future and can’t wait to see where this tech adventure takes me!</p>
